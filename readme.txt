Enhances WordPress Media Library with some features (folders, dominant color, location category and others).

== Description ==

This plugin includes several enhancements to the WordPress Media Library that can be used within specialized themes or separately. The plugin allows users to quickly organize all their media into folders. You can easily drag and drop images into folders and change the tree view of the folders as you wish. The plugin also allows you to calculate the dominant color for all images in your Media Library (which can then be used in different blocks or shortcodes), add different categories and tags to images, create a set of media sizes to display Responsive Images, and much more.

### Folders Features

* Create unlimited folders in the Media Library
* Allows to rename and delete folders
* Drag and drop folders, change order, and hierarchy
* Bulk select images and media files and drag them to any folder
* Assign colors to selected folders
* Lock folders - images in locked folders cannot be used for random selection
* Customize the look and feel of your folders
* Monitor orphaned media library files
* Import folders from other plugins (WP Media Folder)
* Responsive layout
### Other Features

* Calculates the dominant color for all images in the Media Library
* Adds a field displaying the dominant color to the image detail
* Provides an API for getting the dominant color and updating it
* Allows you to add post categories and post tags for images
* Creates a new category 'location' and lets you manage it
* Adds a new meta with the calculated image ratio and displays it in the image detail
* Registers a set of media sizes to display Responsive Images
* Provides API for getting different image properties
* Adds several new color schemes for admin
* Compatible with the latest version of WordPress
